## Professional Summary

Aspiring Platform Engineer with 7+ years designing governed Salesforce platforms and delivery systems for enterprise and public-sector organizations. Specializes in governance-first architecture, CI/CD abstraction, and policy-driven enforcement systems. Currently expanding platform engineering skills into Kubernetes-native control planes and infrastructure orchestration while applying proven architectural patterns from large-scale Salesforce environments.

Known for separating **policy from execution**, designing **deterministic pipelines**, and treating governance as a first-class platform capability rather than an afterthought.

## Core Platform & Engineering Skills

**Platform Engineering (Emerging)**

- Control plane & data plane separation
- Governance-as-Code & policy enforcement
- Adapter-based execution architectures
- Deterministic CI/CD pipelines
- Contract-first validation and arbitration
- Failure-mode driven design

**DevOps & Delivery**

- GitHub Actions (composite actions, reusable workflows)
- Salesforce DX (SFDX CLI, JWT auth, org introspection)
- CI/CD governance & quality gates
- Automated validation & testing (LWC/Jest, linting, static analysis)

**Architecture**

- API-first & contract-first design (OpenAPI 3.0)
- Event-driven architecture
- Multi-environment promotion strategies
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- Systems Architecture Specifications (SAS)

**Programming & Tooling**

- TypeScript, JavaScript, Apex
- Go (in progress)
- JSON schemas, SARIF
- SQL, HTML/CSS

**Cloud & Platforms**

- Salesforce Platform (Service Cloud, Experience Cloud, LWR)
- AWS Lambda (selective off-platform compute)
- Kubernetes & Crossplane (design-stage, active learning)

## Selected Platform & Engineering Projects

### GlassOps Governance Protocol (Open Source)

**Jan 2026 – Present**

An open-source governance protocol defining how policy, validation, and execution are separated in Salesforce CI/CD systems.

- Designed a governance control plane independent of execution tooling.
- Defined normalized deployment contracts (JSON/SARIF) across heterogeneous runners.
- Formalized arbitration logic to merge organizational, team, and environment policy floors.
- Specified immutable audit trails aligned with regulated environments (SOC 2, HIPAA).

**Focus:** Governance-as-Code, control planes, protocol design.

### GlassOps Runtime & Adapter Ecosystem

**Jan 2026 – Present**

Execution layer implementing the GlassOps protocol via adapter-based architecture.

- Developing a TypeScript runtime that bootstraps deterministic execution environments.
- Engineering adapters for scanners, simulators, and CI/CD runners (GitHub Actions, local, containerized).
- Enforcing strict decoupling where governance authority is never embedded in execution tools.
- Designing fault-tolerant primitives to ensure consistent behavior across environments.

---

### Setup Salesforce CLI (GitHub Marketplace)

**Jan 2026 – Present**

Enterprise-grade GitHub Action providing deterministic Salesforce CLI environments.

- Intelligent caching reducing setup time by ~80%.
- Self-healing execution with retries and backoff.
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- Designed as a foundational primitive for reusable, governed CI/CD workflows.

---

### Salesforce Platform Architect Portfolio

**Nov 2025 – Present**

A production-grade reference implementation demonstrating enterprise Salesforce architecture patterns.
