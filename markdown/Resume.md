## Technical Projects

**Open-Source, Architecture-First Reference Implementation** | [Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/rdbumstead/salesforce-reference-architecture)

_An architecture-first reference implementation demonstrating enterprise delivery patterns prior to final UI completion._

- **Executive Strategy:** Authored the [Executive Overview](https://github.com/rdbumstead/salesforce-platform-architect-portfolio/blob/main/docs/guides/01-Executive-Overview.md) to align technical delivery with business value, success criteria, and measurable ROI.
- **Program Governance:** Authored the [Program Charter](https://github.com/rdbumstead/salesforce-platform-architect-portfolio/blob/main/docs/guides/02-Program-Charter.md) and [Technical Guide](https://github.com/rdbumstead/salesforce-platform-architect-portfolio/blob/main/docs/guides/04-Technical-Guide.md) to define scope, phased delivery, and enterprise design standards.
- **Enterprise Architecture:** Authored the Systems Architecture Specification ([SAS](https://github.com/rdbumstead/salesforce-platform-architect-portfolio/blob/main/docs/guides/03-SAS.md)) and [Executable Governance Guide](https://github.com/rdbumstead/salesforce-platform-architect-portfolio/blob/main/docs/guides/06-Guardrails-and-Executable-Governance.md). This design covers a governed multi-cloud architecture across Salesforce LWR, AWS Lambda, and Agentforce AI.
- **API-First Design:** Designed and published contract-first APIs using OpenAPI 3.0. This enforces governance via rate limiting, caching directives, and distributed tracing headers.
- **DevOps Engineering:** Engineered a zero-touch CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and JWT authentication. This implementation includes delta deployments and automated quality gates using PMD and ESLint.
- **Resilience & Chaos Engineering:** Architected controlled failure simulation and chaos engineering patterns to validate the graceful degradation of third-party integrations like GitHub and Jira.
- **Outcome:** Demonstrates end-to-end Salesforce platform architecture combining governance, resilience, DevOps automation, and executive alignment.

**"Resume as Code" CI/CD Pipeline** | [Resume Repository](https://github.com/rdbumstead/resume-as-code)

_A "Zero-Touch" CI/CD pipeline treating professional career documentation as a software product._

- **Infrastructure as Code:** Architected an event-driven build pipeline transforming Markdown source into immutable PDF artifacts using **Node.js**, **Pandoc**, and **GitHub Actions**.
- **Security Architecture:** Implemented a "Secrets-First" design pattern, decoupling PII (Phone, Email) from the codebase using GitHub Secrets and Environment Variables to enable public repository visibility without data leakage.
- **Automated Governance:** Engineered custom Node.js scripts to audit hyperlinks, enforce formatting standards, and inject real-time portfolio statistics via the GitHub API prior to compilation.
- **Tech Stack:** GitHub Actions, Node.js, Docker, Mermaid.js, LaTeX.
